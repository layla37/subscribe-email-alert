Subscribe Email Alert

A WordPress plugin to email subscribers of particular categories when a post or comment has been made. In the dashboard, the admin can see a list of all categories with a checkbox next to each category on each user profile. The admin can subscribe the user to as many categories as they please. Once subscribed, the user will receive an email alert notifying them that a new post or comment on that post has been made.
